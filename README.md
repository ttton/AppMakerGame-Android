AppMaker for Android
====================

Description
-----------

AppMaker for Android is an ongoing experimental, open-source Android game development project. The game was originally intended to be an example of a real-time multiplayer, strategy simulation game on the mobile iOS platform. This project is an Android mirror of the original iOS game.

This game was conceived as a small university project for the purpose of learning iOS development and demonstrating the capabilities of the technology. It now continues to serve as a playground for learning and improving mobile development practices across a variety of platforms, but as a series of community open-source projects instead, so that our discoveries and experience may be shared with others.
